				<h3>EVENRANK's Privacy Commitment Overview</h3>
				<p>EVENRANK is committed to protecting the privacy of our users,
					and strives to provide a safe, secure user experience. This Privacy
					Statement sets forth the online data collection and usage policies
					and practices that apply to this web site. The following statement
					explains EVENRANK's commitment to managing your personal
					information and sets out how and when personal information is
					collected, held, used or disclosed. This Privacy Commitment only
					applies to data gathered on the EVENRANK.com web site (the "Web
					Site"), and does not apply to any other information or web site.</p>
				<p>
					By registering or by using this site, you explicitly accept,
					without limitation or qualification, the collection, use and
					transfer of the personal information provided by you in the manner
					described in this Statement. Please read this Statement carefully
					as it affects your rights and liabilities under law. If you do not
					accept the Privacy Statement stated herein or disagree with the way
					we collect and process personal information collected on the Web
					site, <b>please do not use it.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<u>Scope of this Policy</u>
				</p>
				<p>This policy applies to www.EVENRANK.com. (the “Site” or “Web
					Site”), which is operated and owned by EVENRANK (“EVENRANK” or the
					“Company”). It is EVENRANK's policy to comply with data protection
					legislation. This regulates the processing of information relating
					to you and grants you various rights in respect of your personal
					data.</p>
				<p>The Site contains links to other web sites over which we have
					no control. EVENRANK is not responsible for the privacy policies or
					practices of other web sites to which you choose to link from this
					site. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those
					other web sites so you can understand how they collect, use and
					share your information.</p>
				<p>We also do not control the data use practices of either (a)
					employers or others who may access your information on this site,
					or (b) third party Ad Networks and other third parties with whom we
					work to serve you personalized ads on our sites. We encourage you
					to review the privacy policies and opt-out choices of those third
					parties so you can understand how they collect, use and share your
					information.</p>

				<p>
					<u>Information We Collect and Retain</u>
				</p>
				<p>You may be required to provide us with some personal
					information in order to perform job searches or to read the content
					portions of our Site. We collect the following general types of
					information about you when you visit our Sites: personal
					information, demographic information, behavioral information, and
					indirect information. Sometimes we collect combinations of all
					these types of information. In each case, it is indicated on the
					web site whether any personal or demographic data must be provided
					to use the requested service or not.</p>
				<p>Personal information is information that can be used to
					identify you, or any other individual to whom the information may
					relate, personally. Some examples of personal information that we

					collect in some areas of our Site, depending on the services you
					use and local law, are:</p>
				<ul>

					<li>Your name</li>

					<li>Address</li>

					<li>Email address</li>

					<li>Telephone number</li>

					<li>Salary information</li>

					<li>Education background</li>

					<li>Work experience</li>

					<li>Contact information</li>

					<li>Billing information</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Information about third parties, such as references or
					contacts that you provide to us should have their express written
					consent to do so.</p>
				<p>Demographic information is information that is not unique to
					you in the sense that it refers to selected population
					characteristics, such as your ZIP code or postal code, age,
					preferences, gender, race or ethnicity, occupation, career history,
					interests and favorites.</p>
				<p>We also collect behavioral information regarding how you use
					our site and mobile applications, the areas of our site that you
					visit, what services you access, and information about your
					computer hardware and software including your IP address,
					geolocation, browser and operating system type, domain names,
					access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is
					necessary for analyzing the use of resources, troubleshooting
					problems, preventing fraud, and improving our services.</p>
				<p>In addition, EVENRANK may collect indirect information about
					you when you use certain third party services on our web site and
					the collection of such information is considered necessary for that
					purpose.</p>

				<p>
					<b><u>We do not collect sensitive personal data like:-</u></b>
					financial information such as Bank Account details or Credit Card
					or Debit Card or other payment related details; physical and mental
					or other health conditions or medical records and history;
					Biometric information such as finger prints, voice &amp; facial
					patterns and DNA any other sensitive information which is
					confidential or sensitive by its nature. We do not store
					information of users like password of your e mail account. The
					password of your EVENRANK account automatically get saved in the
					EVENRANK server when you create an account or register with
					EVENRANK and not authorized by EVENRANK for access unless desired
					under any legal obligation.
				</p>
				<p>If you choose to login with Facebook or similar sites, we
					import the information that you choose to share with us by
					installing the application or logging into that platform or site,
					and we make it part of your profile. Because EVENRANK sites and
					applications are intended to allow you to share your information
					and to allow others to find you, we make certain information about
					you publicly available by default. Such information may, for
					example, be accessed by everyone on the Internet, including users
					without accounts, and may appear in public search engine search
					results. However, you can control the visibility of your
					information by managing your privacy settings. You can also
					restrict the information available to others by deleting
					information you do not want visible or by not providing it at all.</p>

				<p>When you post information on another user's profile or
					comment on another user's post, the public availability of that
					information will be subject to the other user's privacy settings.
					We may personalize the advertising that you are shown on our sites
					or other sites with which we have a business relationship. In order
					to provide this personalization, in addition to information we
					collect about you on our sites, we acquire information (including
					personal, demographic, behavioral and indirect information) about
					you from third parties who provide it to us.</p>

				<p>
					<b>How Information is used</b>
				</p>
				<p>We use the information we gather on the web site for the
					purposes of:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>providing our services</li>
					<li>responding to any queries you may have;</li>
					<li>operating and improving the web site;</li>
					<li>fostering a positive user experience; and</li>
					<li>delivering the products and services that we offer to
						jobseekers and employers.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Our services include the display of personalized products,
					content, and advertising relating to your career experience and
					interests, either on our site or other sites with which we have a
					business relationship. The information we gather on any EVENRANK
					web site may be shared within the EVENRANK group of companies or
					any of the EVENRANK-affiliated companies or partners on a worldwide
					basis in order to deliver these products and services we offer to
					employers such as searches for job seekers or in order to undertake
					analysis of our database such as aggregate profiling of our
					registered users. In this Privacy Commitment, "affiliated
					companies" shall mean entities that control, are controlled by or
					are under common control with EVENRANK. Some EVENRANK companies may
					be located in countries that do not have legislation that
					guarantees adequate protection of personal information as defined
					by your country of residence.</p>

				<p>
					<b><u>User's Consent to EVENRANK to Use the Information</u></b>
				</p>
				<p>By registering with EVENRANK, by managing your profile, or
					opting in when presented with choices, you have explicitly
					consented for us to use your information, subject to local law, in
					the following ways:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>to allow you to create an account;</li>
					<li>to create a profile for you based on information that you
						have provided to us information imported from other sites or
						applications, or information provided to us by third parties such
						as your contacts or advertisers;</li>
					<li>to contact you about EVENRANK Site updates, informational
						and service-related communications, including important security
						updates;</li>
					<li>to provide you additional communications, information, and
						promotions such as newsletters and career advice;</li>
					<li>to inform you of other products or services available from
						EVENRANK or its affiliates (“Affiliates” means entities that
						control, are controlled by or are under common control with
						EVENRANK Worldwide, Inc.);</li>
					<li>to enable you to provide feedback, to contact us and for
						us to respond to you;</li>
					<li>to conduct surveys, questionnaires, promotions and
						contests, and to provide the results thereof such as success
						stories and contest winners;</li>
					<li>to provide information about you and your potential
						interest in job postings to employer customers;</li>
					<li>to provide products and services to employer customers to
						complete the recruitment and hiring process, such as accessing the
						searchable resume database;</li>
					<li>to help your friends, contacts, and potential employers
						find your profile and connect with you;</li>
					<li>to allow you to share jobs and profile information with
						your connections;</li>
					<li>to give search engines access to public information;</li>
					<li>to detect, investigate and prevent activities that may
						violate our policies or be illegal;</li>
					<li>to provide products and services that enable users to
						network, post information on bulletin boards, view and compare
						profiles, and career background and experience;</li>
					<li>to generate internal reports about the use of our site;
						and</li>
					<li>to provide 'forward to a friend' features.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Some of our products and services, such as our searchable
					resume database and networking, enable third parties to see your
					personal information and to contact you. Profile information may be
					used for networking with other community members or may be visible
					to employers who are using the EVENRANK Sites. In addition,
					portions of your searchable resume (but not your contact
					information) may be made public in your networking profile.</p>
				<p>Information you post in public areas of the site or place in
					the searchable resume database will be accessed, used, and stored
					by others around the world, including those in countries that might
					not have legislation that guarantees adequate protection of
					personal information as defined by your country of residence. By
					providing your personal information for inclusion in our database,
					you acknowledge that you consent to your information being used as
					described here. While EVENRANK takes measures to safeguard your
					information from unauthorized access or inappropriate use by third
					parties, EVENRANK does not control these third parties and we are
					not responsible for their use of information you post or otherwise
					make available in public areas of the EVENRANK Sites. Accordingly,
					you should ensure that you do not post sensitive information,
					including personality profiles, to any EVENRANK Site. We use data
					we have about you to determine whether you might be interested in
					the opportunities, products or services of a particular third
					party. We show you targeted ads on our sites or other sites with
					which we have a business relationship. These ads are targeted based
					on information we collect about you and information about you we
					acquire from third parties.</p>

				<p>
					<b><u>Information about all EVENRANK Visitors</u></b>
				</p>
				<p>We gather information about all of our users collectively,
					such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services
					users access the most. We only use such data anonymously and in the
					aggregate. This information helps us determine what is most
					beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a
					better overall experience for you. We may share this information

					with our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may
					understand how EVENRANK visitors use our Web Site, and also create
					a better overall experience for you. We do not disclose information
					about your individual visits to EVENRANK to any outside parties,
					except when to the extent necessary or appropriate to comply with
					applicable laws, rules or regulations or in legal proceedings when
					such information is relevant.</p>

				<p>
					<b><u>Information about you specifically</u></b>
				</p>
				<p>EVENRANK is a career site; we retain your personal
					information to assist in your career performance or management
					including finding or retaining work; or to facilitate other
					services to or by us.</p>
				<p>For example, when you sign up to use a service, enter into a
					contest, or purchase a product, we collect more specific personal
					information about you, such as your name, address, email address,
					telephone number, qualifications or career history.</p>
				<p>If you choose to do so we may also retain sensitive
					information about you such as information about your membership in
					a professional or trade association or trade union.</p>
				<p>We may also ask you for other information, such as
					information on your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding
					the Web Site, the types of jobs you are interested in, etc., in an
					effort to deliver to you the best possible Web Site experience.
					When you grant us your permission, we will communicate with you
					regularly with tips, advice and survey information on using the

					EVENRANK Web Site to maximize your career development. EVENRANK
					also provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of these types of
					communications. If you choose to receive these types of
					communications at the time of registration, but later decide you no
					longer want to receive them, simply log in to your EVENRANK account
					and edit your account settings.</p>

				<p>If you input your information on a co-branded registration
					page, such as that of a EVENRANK and partner company-sponsored
					contest, then your information will be collected, used and becomes
					the property of both EVENRANK and the partner co-sponsoring the
					contest. In that instance, EVENRANK is not responsible for the
					information that the partner company receives or how it is used.</p>
				<p>If you do not provide us with the information sought in the
					required fields EVENRANK may be limited in its ability to provide
					you with services.</p>

				<p>
					<b><u>Use and Disclosure of the Information we collect</u></b>
				</p>
				<p>We use the information we gather on the Web Site, whether
					personal, demographic, collective or technical, for the purposes of
					operating and improving the Web Site, fostering a positive user
					experience, and delivering the products and services that we offer.</p>
				<p>If you have provided consent for us to do so, we may also use
					the information we gather to inform you of other products or
					services available from us or our affiliated companies or to
					contact you about your opinion of current products and services or
					potential new products and services that may be offered.</p>
				<p>We may use your contact information in order to send you
					e-mail or other communications regarding updates at the Web Site to
					contact you about your opinion of current products and services or
					potential new products and services that may be offered. We may
					also provide additional communications, promotions and information
					on new EVENRANK opportunities, and additional job postings which
					may be of interest to you. The nature and frequency of these

					messages will vary depending upon the information we have about
					you.</p>
				<p>In addition, at the time of registration for an account, you
					have the option to elect or not elect to receive additional
					communications, information and promotions, including without
					limitation, free informational newsletters from us relating to
					topics that may be of special interest to you, such as career
					management advice.</p>
				<p>EVENRANK cannot ensure that all of your private
					communications and other personal information will never be
					disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy
					Commitment. Therefore, although we are committed to protecting your
					privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your
					personal information or private communications will always remain
					private. As a user of the Web Site, you understand and agree that
					you assume all responsibility and risk for your use of the Web
					Site, the internet generally, and the documents you post or access
					and for your conduct on and off the Web Site.</p>

				<p>
					<b><u>Disclosure of Information to Others</u></b>
				</p>
				<p>We disclose to third parties within your country and abroad
					your personal information, combined personal, demographic,
					behavioral or indirect information, as set forth below:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>We disclose your resume to employers who have posted job
						opportunities that may be of interest to you on the Web Site when
						you apply for those jobs.</li>
					<li>We may share your information with third parties who help
						us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. We
						disclose information to companies and individuals we employ to
						perform functions on our behalf. Examples include hosting our web
						servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance,
						processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.
						These companies and individuals may be located in a country, whose
						data protection legislation is different from your country, and
						they will have access to your personal information as necessary to
						perform their functions, but they may not share that information
						with any other third party or use that data for any other purpose.
						We will remain responsible for any information shared in this way.</li>
					<li>We may disclose such information to third parties if you
						consent to such disclosure. For example, if you make your resume
						searchable, then all parties with access to our searchable resume
						database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume. If
						you indicate by configuring your profile that you would like to
						receive information about the opportunities, products or services
						of third parties, we supply your contact information to select
						third parties such as employers, recruiters, data aggregators,
						marketers or others for the purpose of sending you e-mail or
						otherwise communicating with you. We use data we have about you
						(such as the interests and preferences you have expressed) to
						determine whether you might be interested in the opportunities,
						products or services of a particular third party. For example, if
						you indicate that you would like to receive information about the
						opportunities, products or services of third parties at the time
						you register for a EVENRANK account, we supply your contact
						information to third parties such as employers, recruiters, data
						aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you
						e-mail or otherwise communicating with you.

						<p>We also share aggregated anonymous information about
							visitors to the Sites with EVENRANK’s clients, partners, other
							Site visitors, and other third parties so that they can
							understand the kinds of visitors to the Sites and how those
							visitors use the Sites in order to serve advertisements to you on
							our Sites or other sites with which we have a business
							relationship. We may also aggregate on an anonymous basis data
							regarding job qualifications, schooling, age, experience level or
							other information relevant to the job search or competition among
							job seekers for any such job. Such aggregated data does not
							identify users individually, and may be made available to
							employers or fellow job seekers or community members. We disclose
							information to companies and individuals we employ to perform
							functions on our behalf. Examples include hosting our web
							servers, data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit
							card payments, and providing customer service. These companies
							and individuals will have access to your personal information as
							may necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share
							that information with any other third party.</p>
						<p>We supply technology, hosting, hiring management and
							related services to other leading companies to power recruitment
							areas on their Web sites (sometimes referred to as “Hosted Career
							Sites”). Personal and/or demographic information supplied by you
							in Hosted Career Sites becomes part of the EVENRANK database, but
							it is not accessible by anyone other than you, EVENRANK, and the
							company concerned without your consent. If you attempt to
							register with EVENRANK after registering with a Hosted Career
							Site, EVENRANK will recognize your information and you will be
							able to use the information you provided to the Hosted Career
							Site in your account registration.</p>

						<p>Information gathered on a page in a Hosted Career Site area
							or on a co-branded page may be retained by both EVENRANK and the
							other company. In that instance, the use of such information by
							the other company will be subject to the privacy policy of that
							company and EVENRANK is not responsible for that company's use of
							your personal or demographic information.</p>
						<p>If you apply for a position through a Hosted Career Site or
							a co-branded site, you may be asked to provide information on
							your age, gender or race where permitted by law. You should
							understand that, if provided, this information should only be
							used by employers in accordance with applicable law. However,
							EVENRANK is not responsible for the actions of such employers.
							All such information provided will be kept separate by EVENRANK
							from your expression of interest in any job opportunity.
							Providing this information is strictly voluntary and you will not
							be subject to any adverse action or treatment from EVENRANK if
							you choose not to provide this information.</p>
						<p>If you apply for a position on EVENRANK through a Hosted
							Career Site, you may be asked to provide information on your
							gender, race, or other protected status, or for a government
							identity number where permitted by applicable law. Some employers
							are required by law to gather this information from job
							applicants for reporting and record-keeping requirements. You
							should understand that if provided, this information may only be
							used by employers only in accordance with applicable law and they
							should not use it in making any negative employment decisions.
							All information provided will be kept separate from your
							expression of interest in any job opportunity. Providing this
							information is subject to local law.</p>
					</li>
					<li>We disclose information if legally required to do so, or
						at our discretion pursuant to a request from a governmental entity
						or if we believe in good faith after considering your privacy
						interests and other factors that such action is necessary to: (a)
						conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b)
						protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c)
						prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the
						personal safety of users or the public. EVENRANK is an Indian
						Organisation and your information may become subject to Indian. We
						may disclose and transfer such information to a third party who
						acquires any or all of EVENRANK's business units, whether such
						acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all
						or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event
						EVENRANK becomes the subject of an insolvency proceeding, whether
						voluntary or involuntary, EVENRANK or its liquidator,
						administrator, receiver or administrative receiver may sell,
						license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction
						approved by the court. You will be notified of the sale of all or
						a substantial portion of our business to a third party by email or
						through a prominent notice posted on the Sites.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					<b><u>An Important Note about Your Resume</u></b>
				</p>
				<p>We give you the option of putting your resume in our
					database.</p>
				<p>When you create or post a resume to the Sites, that resume is
					stored in our searchable resume database in India. You may control
					the status of your resume by setting it to private or public.</p>
				<p>You can store your resume in our database, but not allow it
					to be searchable by potential employers or recruiters. Not allowing
					your resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for
					a job online, but employers and recruiters will not have access to
					search it through our resume database product.</p>
				<p>If you mark your profile as "not actively looking for job",
					it is not searchable by potential employers or other with access to
					our resume database. You may still use your resume to apply online
					to a job. If you do apply online to a job, your resume will be
					transferred to the relevant employer, who may retain a copy of your
					resume or distribute it to third parties. We cannot control their
					use or retention of your resume information.</p>
