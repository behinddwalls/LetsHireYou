				<h3>Safe Search</h3>
				<p>Any Job Search should be a Safe Search First !</p>
				<p>While the Internet is a safe and convenient place to do
					business, be aware that scammers are out there targeting
					unsuspecting consumers.</p>
				<p>
					There have been quite a few cases in recent past <b>where
						jobseekers were offered opportunities that just sound too good to
						be true.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Regrettably, from time to time, false job postings are listed
					online and used to illegally collect personal information and money
					from unsuspecting job seekers. The placement of such false job
					postings is a violation of the EVENRANK <a
						href="${contextPath}/about/tnc">Terms of Use</a>. <b>EVENRANK
						does not take any responsibility of such clients and cannot be
						held responsible for any loss or damage so occurred.</b>
				</p>
				<p>But EVENRANK is dedicated to stopping this abuse and
					providing the safest possible environment for you to search and
					apply to jobs and manage your career.</p>
				<p>
					Tips to avoid fraud<br />To steer clear of fraudulent business
					opportunities, follow these tips:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Don't get involved with an employer that can't make its
						business model perfectly clear to you or one that's willing to
						hire you without even a phone interview.</li>
					<li>EVENRANK does not allow job postings which require money
						deposits from jobseekers, so if you come across any job which asks
						for money, please inform us.</li>
					<li>Never give your bank account, credit card or any secure
						numbers to an employer whose legitimacy you cannot independently
						verify. These numbers can be used to steal from you or launder
						funds stolen from others.</li>
					<li>Do your own research - via the Internet or with a business
						librarian's help - on any employer that makes you feel at all
						uneasy.</li>
					<li>Rational people can make irrational decisions when under
						stress. If you are in financial trouble, recognize your
						vulnerability and think twice before you make matters worse by
						getting involved in a suspicious employment scheme.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Reporting fraud</h4>
				<p>
					If you see a questionable Job Posting or any potential misuse of
					the EVENRANK site or its brand, please report the suspected fraud
					to <a href="mailto:fraud@evenrank.com">EVENRANK</a>.

					If you think you have been a victim of fraud, immediately report
					the committed fraud to your local police and contact <a
						href="mailto:fraud@evenrank.com">EVENRANK</a>, so steps can be
					taken for your safety.
